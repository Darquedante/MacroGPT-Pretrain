Jim checked suddenly, aware of a sensation inside him that he had been too numb with sleep to appreciate until now. He turned to Liseth, who had also stopped and was looking at him curiously.\n\n\"Would you leave me in this room by myself for a few minutes more? It will only be a moment. Let no one else enter.\"\n\n\"No one shall so much as approach its doorway, m'Lord!\" said Liseth fiercely. \"You can trust me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do!\" said Jim. She went out, closing the door behind her.\n\nLeft alone, he hastily began to unlace from their points the leather cord that held up his hose, and approached his chamber pot. It had been a long night and he had not woken once. He urinated in the chamber pot with a great sense of relief, then hastily redid his points and went back out and hastily up to Liseth.\n\n\"I did not mean to be so long,\" he said.\n\n\"Long?\" said Liseth. \"But it was only a moment, as you said.\""

You have heard of those stolen by the fairies, or Naturals, who thought they were gone only days and returned to find that years had gone by?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Liseth again, \"my nurse used to tell me all those old tales. I particularly remember the tale of Cinderella and her slipper—and how the Prince she married made her wicked step-mother and step-sisters dance in red-hot boots at their wedding. I laughed and laughed!\"\n\n\"Er—yes,\" said Jim.\n\nThey went on down, to the foot of the stairs; and out through the Great Hall and into the stables. These, unlike the kitchens, were in an outbuilding at a small distance from the tower, in the courtyard.\n\nIt was only when they stepped into the furious scene of activity that was the stable, that Jim remembered he had left his weapons, his armor and most of the things he would need for at least an overnight trip still up in Sir Brian's room. He was searching his mind for some way of making a further excuse to go back up and get them, when he noticed them in a pile by the stable door of his war horse, Gorp."

You picked out just the right things, just what I'd need. I'm indebted to you.\"\n\n\"Indebted to me?\" echoed Liseth, frowning. \"Surely not, m'Lord. These are only those things that belong to you. Nothing of mine or of the Castle de Mer has been added to them.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Jim, \"pardon my ill choice of words, m'Lady. We magicians sometimes speak a little differently from ordinary people. I should have said I'm obliged to you.\"\n\nHe saw at this moment a groom come out of the stall that held Gorp, leading the horse, which was already saddled and with Jim's lance upright in its socket to the right front of his saddle.\n\n\"I will assist you in donning your armor, m'Lord, if you wish,\" said Liseth.\n\nLooking at her, for the first time, it struck Jim that the expression on her face was definitely very demure. For the first time he realized that he might have become attractive to her, as he had found himself to be—even in his dragon body—to Danielle o'the Wold. In both cases it had been the same thing. It had been the aura of magic about him. Danielle had fantasized that he was an enchanted Prince. Or, at least, that was what Danielle seemed to be doing, unless she had simply been using Jim to make Dafydd, her future husband at that time, jealous."

In both cases there was the dream of marvels, wonders and riches to be gained by even being close to someone with magic. No doubt, as with lotteries, the chances of gaining any of these things that magic promised were one in a million; nonetheless it was exciting even to be in the vicinity of such a possibility.\n\nHastily, Jim began to get into the armor, pausing only to eat from the bread and meat and drink from the wine that was being handed around to them. Liseth helped him put the armor on. It did not slow him down any to see that Herrac and his five sons were already armored, packed and on horseback, and Lachlan was almost armored and ready—in spite of being still somewhat drunk from the night before; and scowling at Jim and Liseth, for no apparent reason.\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nThey made, Jim had to admit, as they rode northward with the rising sun of morning to their right, a pretty effective-looking band. He had read once, in an excellent book on the Scottish Border, how most Borderers could put an armed force out of bed in the middle of the night and into the saddle, ready for the hot pursuit of raiders who had driven off their cattle, within something like twenty minutes or so."

Beside him was Sir Herrac, who bulked enormous in his armor, on a large, heavy-headed war horse which seemed well able to carry its rider, plus its own armor of hanging mail.\n\nJim had not sought out this position; but had found it made available to him, so obviously that he had no choice but to take it up.\n\nThe truth of the matter was, he thought to himself, that he was once more in the grasp of that almost ridiculous fourteenth-century method of assuming that those of highest rank should naturally lead—officially, at least, in any time and at any place. Particularly when the proceeding was toward possible battle.\n\nRight behind him rode Lachlan and Sir Giles, both of whom he knew had more right to be up front here than himself.

And all because he'd been idiot enough when he first landed on this world to claim that he was a baron, thinking it would be a help.\n\nThat claim had got him into more trouble since than all the help it could possibly have afforded him.\n\nHe rode along with his face apparently serene, but his mind whirling inside. What he knew about ambushes you could put in a thimble and still not see with a microscope. Particularly, ambushes involving fourteenth-century weapons and fighters.\n\nDamn it, he thought to himself, he should have had time before they set out to contact Snorrl again and alert him about the ambush. Also time, above all, to meet with the Little Men once more and somehow get them committed to join in the final battle against the Hollow Men. It was typical of the people riding with him that they did almost all things wrong end to."

But there was no polite way to fall back from riding at Herrac's side, at this moment. He would just have to be patient until they stopped for some kind of a break, or finally reached the place that was to be their destination.\n\nIt turned out to be waiting until they reached their destination. There were no breaks along the way that allowed him any chance at an extended conversation with Lachlan. In the end, Jim was forced to hold himself in until they had reached the spot on the trail which Lachlan had picked for the ambush.\n\nThey were a little off the trail. Not so much in a clearing, as in a spot where the pines around them were not growing too thickly. Yet there was room to unsaddle the horses, and sit down together; to help themselves to some of the bread, meat and wine Herrac had had brought along on a baggage horse."

A wagon might have gotten down it; but it would have had to have been a very thin wagon. In fact, the trail, as Jim persisted in thinking of it, was really fit only for a couple of horsemen riding abreast as they had been.\n\nFor some distance before they had reached their present position and ahead of them as far as Jim could see, the land through which the trail ran was fairly level. However, from where they were now, for some seventy-five to a hundred yards before and about the same distance behind them, the ground sloped upward on either side away from the trail. Both sides were thickly treed; as had been most of the landscape through which they had passed just recently."

Moreover, the sun was now at noon overhead, and its heat was enough to make Jim, at least, uncomfortable inside his gambeson and armor. His companions—just as Brian and Dafydd had seemed indifferent to the chill on their way up to the Castle de Mer—now seemed indifferent also to the warmth of the day.\n\nTemperatures, apparently, from a fourteenth-century point of view, were something over which you had no control; so, when there was no way of alleviating them either with clothes or walls, you simply ignored them.

What is your counsel on that, Lachlan?\"\n\n\"You're right enough,\" said Lachlan. \"They'll cease their travel as the day darkens and chills; and set up camp for the night. The MacDougall was ever a man who liked his comfort. He'll want a fire going and food and wine at his elbow, well before sunset.\"\n\n\"As I thought,\" said Herrac. \"Therefore, we have time to become settled about our plans. What're your commands, m'Lord?\"\n\nThere it was, thought Jim fatalistically. He was in charge whether he liked it or not. Perhaps the others would have wisdom enough to give him reasons why what he told them to do was not practical. He hoped so. A thought occurred to him.\n\nThere was one thing he was allowed, as leader. It was that, in typical leadership fashion, he could call for the opinions of those who would be fighting with him. Normally, this would mean sampling the opinions only of those who were sub-leaders.

They were in a rough circle seated cross-legged on the pine needles. \"They'll be riding two and two, down the road, with the MacDougall in the lead, with—it might be—a sumpter horse behind him; and then, it might be, the six or eight armed men he'll have with him, mounted, with one or two horses carrying the gold in their midst. At a signal, we charge on foot down upon them—\"\n\nHe turned to Herrac.\n\n\"You'll have seen me do this in wee fights we've been in together before,\" he said to Herrac. \"It's a matter of ducking under the bellies of the horses, ripping those bellies up with our daggers—and out with us, the other side. The horses will rear, and most of their riders will go off them. Those that hit the ground will be fairly easy for the killing. The MacDougall himself is likely to do little, if once his men are taken down. But one of us should go ahead to bar the road before him, lest he take off at a gallop with the sumpter horse and maybe the horses carrying the gold as well, and we, unhorsed, are left behind.\""

Nor was it to duck under a horse's belly and slice open his guts like any naked Heilandman! When I fight, I fight as a man and a knight should, on horseback, shield to shield and sword to sword, if there is not room for lance-work. And so shall fight my sons.\"\n\n\"And so say I also, Father!\" cried Giles.\n\n\"Ah, you're become as foolish as the English theirselves!\" cried Lachlan in disgust. \"And you call yourselves Northumbrians!\"\n\nThere seemed to be the nucleus of a fair-sized quarrel threatening to break out between two of the most important members of the expedition.

We will not fight on foot.\"\n\nWell, thought Jim, that was that. He had grown experienced in having the door of medieval custom slammed in his face. It was plain Herrac meant exactly what he said. That meant he would stand behind it with his life.\n\n\"It ill beseems it,\" the soft but carrying voice of Dafydd broke the silence, which was beginning to threaten to be awkward, \"for an archer to speak up in such a company of gentles.

But with Christopher barring the way, there are only five of you, and myself, and I gather it's likely there will be at least six of them. I have no doubt that you consider yourselves more than equal to those six, by yourselves.

But the flash was not of the gold with which the Hollow Men would be paid; but of gold facings on the surcoat over the armor of the lead rider in the procession.\n\nThat flash of gold, and the arms beneath it—which Lachlan immediately identified as the MacDougall arms—not even counting the pennant flying from the upright staff beside the surcoated man's saddle, announced that their quarry approached."

With a blood-curdling whoop, he stuck his spurs into Gorp and charged on the horse into the attack, to the rescue of the endangered son.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nJim cannoned into the man-at-arms who was driving back William de Mer, at the same time getting in a blow with his sword hard enough to send the man-at-arms halfway out of his saddle. The collision came with both his own weight and that of Gorp—who was not only a good-sized horse; but, furthermore, outraged. Jim had never stuck spurs into him before. Wanting to get back at somebody—anybody—he screamed and struck out at the smaller horse of the man-at-arms with his front hooves, almost as if he had been a properly trained war horse."

The other regained his saddle; but, so unexpectedly caught by a second opponent, and particularly by one who was standing up on his stirrups and hitting down at him from a slightly larger horse, found himself suddenly on the defensive.\n\nHe switched his attention completely from William, who drifted off, clinging to his horse; while his former opponent did his best to turn matters into a duel directly between Jim and himself.\n\nIf Jim had not been so carried away—it struck him later that some of Lachlan's enthusiasm might have gotten through to him, because there was something oddly terrifying about a naked, armed man charging a line of armored enemies—he might not have done so well. As it was, however, Jim simply proceeded to overpower the man-at-arms, hammering him out of the saddle, Herrac-style.\n\nSuddenly, the small battlefield was still. Horses and men alike were standing, or sitting panting, or lying on the ground. And nobody stirred until Herrac leaped from his saddle like a twenty-year-old and ran to the son who had been knocked out of his saddle."

To Herrac, the death of his first-born son would be unusually severe; unconsciously as well as consciously these many years, he had been planning for and training Alan to succeed him as master of the castle and its lands.\n\nJim got down from his horse, pushed his way past Lachlan and the other sons and knelt on the other side of Alan. He held his hands over the slackly open mouth and smiled across at Herrac, who was holding Alan's head and rocking back and forth like a tower of doom about to fall on anything nearby.\n\n\"He's breathing,\" said Jim.\n\nHerrac burst into tears.\n\nOnce upon a time the sight of such a man crying would have been shocking to Jim; but he had found out long since that both men and women of the fourteenth century cried as easily as children.

They clustered around Alan and gently began to get his armor off.\n\nJim carefully searched Alan's body with his hands, looking for any sign of a wound, but found none. He took the other's lax wrist and felt for a pulse. It was there, and regular but slow.\n\nHe frowned, but quickly erased the frown at the flash of sudden fear in Herrac's eyes.\n\n\"Alan seems perfectly unhurt,\" said Jim. \"The only danger could possibly be concussion...\"\n\nHe lifted his head and looked at the two nearest brothers, those who had been next to Alan when they charged the men-at-arms.\n\n\"Did either of you see what happened to Alan? When was he hit by the man-at-arms he rode against?\"\n\n\"The man-at-arms hit him once,\" said Hector, one of the two spoken to. \"It did not look like a hard blow to me, Sir James, but Alan fell immediately out of his saddle.\""

The other thought that was in his mind was that there might be something about Alan himself that had caused him to go into a faint on being hit. But since this took him into an area of medicine about which he knew nothing at all, and besides could only frighten the de Mer family without offering any comfort or reassurance, he said nothing about it.\n\n\"Bring me some water or wine,\" Jim said.\n\nIt was brought. Jim made a few passes over it with one hand, while muttering under his breath, for the general purpose of cheering his audience with the thought that something magical in addition to the ordinary moistening of skin was at work here. Then he took one of the wadded cloths that he carried in a very unfourteenth-century pocket Angie had sewn on the inside of his shirt, dipped it in the wine—it would be wine, after all, that they brought, of course, he thought—and carefully bathed Alan's face."

He glanced back at the knot of de Mers still clustered around the fallen Alan. The MacDougall could not have got a close enough look at Herrac and his sons to know who they were, and the less he knew the better, if he was going to go on living.

There's no point in bringing trouble upon Castle de Mer. In fact, Lachlan and I may well not return there; but camp out with the prisoner at least for one night and possibly more.

He was busily thinking of what should be done next. He must first get away on his own and he must contact the wolf Snorrl.

Lachlan would take orders only to a degree; in no sense with the obedience of Herrac's sons—and even Herrac, himself.\n\nAbout one thing Jim was determined. They would not go back to the castle. He would have to think of how to break the news of this to Lachlan. Luckily, he had a little time before that would become necessary. They would have to follow Herrac and his sons for some distance back toward the castle before parting ways with them, in any case.

Consequently Lachlan said nothing as they watched the de Mer family go by them and get a good distance ahead of them, more than far enough for them to be unrecognizable in their armor to MacDougall.\n\nThen, he, Jim and MacDougall began to follow. It had been a ride of another six hours coming out to the spot where they had waylaid the golden-surcoated clan chief. It took even longer going back, since Alan was obeying orders and riding at a slow walk, which meant the rest were doing the same.\n\nConsequently, it was getting on to late afternoon by the time they reached the point where Jim began to feel that they should part company with Herrac and his sons; and the trees, which now stood less thickly around the trail, were throwing long shadows at a slant toward the still invisible seashore against which Castle de Mer was built.

But for all Jim could see, the unvoiced threat bounced off their prisoner without doing anything more than stirring his attention for a second.\n\nSo far, MacDougall had not said a word. He continued silent as they turned off the track and found a tree about a foot in diameter, and all of them got off their horses.\n\nLachlan, himself, took on the job of tying MacDougall's hands behind him around the trunk of the tree.

Of course, thought Jim, the latter reason may have been why he had left them."

Could you make sure that he doesn't get into any trouble if the two of us leave him alone?\"\n\n\"That I can,\" said Lachlan. He proceeded to use everything including the saddle girths from MacDougall's horse's saddle to tie the other to the frame of a bed that was little more than a wooden tray on the ground with some dried grass inside to soften it.\n\n\"Now,\" said Lachlan, standing back. \"He'll do for a few minutes. But I'd not give him much more than a few before we come back, slippery callant that he is.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Jim, and led the way outside, closing the door behind them.\n\nBy now, the moon had begun to show itself above the trees higher on the hill above the pasture. It shed very little light, being only approaching full, but it was better than the starlight only that had been available before.

What ye must do is see him in something like the court setting he's used to; and there's no such thing near here like that, except Castle de Mer. Moreover, to see him as he normally struts and talks, he'll have to be let loose in most of the castle rooms, with only guards on the outer door to keep him from leaving the building.\"\n\n\"But that will involve the de Mers!\" said Jim. \"The very thing I don't want to do!\"\n\n\"Ye've no choice,\" said Lachlan. \"If ye want what ye say ye want, that's the only way to get it.

For one thing, a wee cattle hut like this is no setting for him. Also, there's none of the type of gentles he's used to showing off to, unless he gets to the de Mers'. He'll have to go there, and he'll have to know he's there. We can solve that easily enough afterwards, with one thrust of a dagger.\"\n\nJim winced in the darkness. That was not the type of solution he was hoping to come up with.\n\n\"I still don't—\" he was beginning.\n\n\"Be sensible, man!\" said Lachlan exasperatedly. \"It's a popinjay ye have in there, and popinjays only dance on the proper perch. It's not their nature to do anything else. Is there no way ye can understand that?\"\n\nJim had encountered this sort of situation before. He had constantly to remind himself that he did not really know these people. Even after almost two years he did not know all about how they acted; or even a great deal about why they chose to act, when they did.

Well, we should get some sleep. But for all that he made no move while we were outside talking, it's best we take turns sleeping.

For another, his mind was still churning, trying to come up with ideas to make his wild plans work. He had a general idea of what he wanted to do; from impersonating the MacDougall to arranging things so that all the Hollow Men had to be in that spot that Snorrl had found for him.

In fact, he preened himself to her to such an extent that her brothers began to develop the beginnings of a dangerous scowl upon their faces. It was only Jim's giving an appealing look to Herrac, who was wise enough to understand what was going on, and Herrac's voiced order to his sons, that prevented trouble.\n\n\"Remember at all times, my children,\" he said, letting his large voice roll forth when there was a point of the conversation at which it was appropriate to do so, \"that though m'Lord MacDougall here may be our prisoner, he is also a gentleman and a guest in this castle, and we must always show all courtesy to him.

They went off, followed by MacDougall's disappointed eyes—fastened on Liseth, of course, rather than Jim.\n\n\"I do indeed want to know about Brian,\" said Jim, as they began their ascent of the winding staircase toward the invalid's room. \"But I also want to make other plans with you. But to Brian, first. How has he been since I left? Also, were you able to change bandages every day; and how did the wound look each time you did?\"\n\n\"We changed the bandages each morning, as you demonstrated, m'Lord,\" said Liseth. \"The wound seems to be mending apace—indeed, with almost miraculous speed, thanks no doubt to your magic, Sir James. It hardly bleeds now, when the bandage is pulled loose—which is a marvel, considering it has only been a couple of days. There is no sign of the redness in the skin around it that you warned me to look for, either.

They will be the first of the spring vegetables.\"\n\nWhen she said this, Jim's own mouth began to water; and he felt a tremendous admiration for Liseth's calm proposal of this.

Then, when you did finally get to a vegetable, particularly one you liked, often its season was all too short.\n\nHe imagined that Liseth, and everyone else, had been giving a great deal of attention to the castle's vegetable gardens for some time. The servants who first discovered these onions might have been kept from immediately grubbing them up and eating them by the fear of what might happen to them if they did. Particularly if word got back to those two who were Lord and Lady of the castle.\n\nBut it would have taken real self-denial on Liseth's part—and she surely must have been the first one to hear about the onions—to suggest they be given only to Sir Brian. On the other hand, he reflected, honor had long since laid its iron hand upon her as strongly as upon the male members of the household.\n\nNaturally the only wounded man in the castle should have first offering of the new vegetables. On the other hand, it would have been all too easy to invent some excuse for not giving them to him—possibly the argument that they might not be good for him just at the present moment."

Nor his unshaven face.\n\n\"Now!\" said Brian, releasing him. \"Tell me all that has occurred.\"\n\nJim proceeded to do so, as he turned back the covers and began to uncover the wound. The bandage came loose with very little difficulty; and once the wound was uncovered, it only seeped blood in a few places. There was no sign of inflammation around the edges of the wound.\n\nJim was secretly astounded. It was true that the original slash, though long, had been hardly more than skin deep.

Probably for every grown person you saw there were four to five infants, children and teen-agers who had not survived to the age of twenty.\n\nHe knew that inheritance and accustomation could arm people to deal with exposure to germs and viruses that others could not stand. Back in his own castle, the local people could, with no trouble—though they much preferred at least small beer—drink the water from the castle well. The only time Jim had tried it he had trouble believing, even in remembrance, how sick he had gotten. Angie was always careful to boil any water that she and Jim were likely to encounter, not only in drinking but in cooking.\n\nHowever, right here and now it was Brian's recovery that was the matter under consideration; and the patient clearly was aware of it."

If so, it had headed in the right direction.\n\nEventually the overpowering figure of Herrac appeared in the doorway through which Liseth had earlier vanished.\n\n\"M'Lord,\" he said, \"forgive me for not drawing you aside before, but I thought it best to give an appearance of complete normality for a short while in front of the MacDougall.

The Lady Liseth understands, of course, that this is simply a matter of her public behavior with MacDougall. I am not asking her anything beyond the bounds of good manners, or anything that would be in any way distasteful to her.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" rumbled Herrac, \"I agree. You are a gentleman, as well as being a magician, and I would not conceive of your suggesting anything improper to my daughter. Tell me, has she agreed to this?\"\n\n\"She has,\" said Jim, \"just now, as we were leaving the room where Sir Brian lies. —By the by, I have given him permission to come down to dinner.

Somewhat the same look with which a person might watch performing fleas.\n\nDown on the main floor alongside the lower table that stretched away toward the front entrance, in an open space, Christopher had produced a lute, and was now playing a tune on it while Lachlan was dancing.\n\nJim stared at him in a certain amount of amazement. He had seen Scottish dancers before, at fairs and festivals and special occasions. But by and large they had been young girls. Even in their case, he had marveled.

To Jim the dancer did not seem to be doing badly; but his brothers hooted with laughter.

He passed them both cups and filled them. Down on the floor, one of the other brothers was now dancing—or trying to dance—with instructions and orders from Lachlan, who clearly had no high opinion of any of these boys when it came to getting up on their toes and moving as he, Lachlan, had.\n\nJim sat and watched Ewen MacDougall. But Liseth was still being an ice-maiden, which puzzled Jim seriously. This was not exactly the reaction he had asked of her. Happily, in time he remembered Angie his wife, occasionally saying pretty much the same sort of thing Liseth had when the de Mer chatelaine had warned him to trust her, even if she seemed to be acting in a way that he did not expect. Clearly, what she was doing now, she evidently thought would bring the MacDougall to heel earlier."

And, gradually, Jim saw Liseth apparently seeming to thaw under this concentrated pressure.\n\nIn the end, she finally agreed to tread a single measure with him, of a more courtly dance. It turned out Christopher knew only one tune that would suit itself to that sort of dance. But he played this; and MacDougall decorously led Liseth at arm's length through the paces of the dance, explaining the moves as he made them. Whether she really needed this instruction, Jim could not make up his mind. But she followed MacDougall's directions docilely enough.\n\nHowever, once the dance was over she returned to being an ice-maiden, at her end of the bench; and continued that attitude through dinner and up to the point where she left for bed.\n\nJim followed shortly thereafter. The time he had set for getting up in the morning was early, even though he had adjusted to fourteenth-century standards to a certain extent. He knew, particularly after the amount of wine that he could not avoid drinking without giving offense to his hosts if he stayed, he would feel like death warmed over when Dafydd finally came to wake him up in the cold pre-dawn."

Of course, thought Jim, Lachlan was not one of them this time. Jim and Herrac were in full armor, including lances; Dafydd rode behind them all with his long bow slung over one shoulder and a quiver full of arrows on his hip. Liseth rode on the other side of her father from Jim; or if the way became too narrow, she dropped a little behind. Snorrl, of course, ranged ahead.\n\nThey were all fully armed. Liseth even had a broadsword in its sheath, attached to a belt hidden, like the broadsword itself, in the folds of her outer dress and under her cloak.\n\nIt was unheard of for a gentlewoman to wear a sword. But Jim felt sure that she would not be wearing it without her father's knowledge and approval; and if he agreed to her carrying the weapon, then undoubtedly she had learned to use it.\n\nIn addition, she would also undoubtedly have a dagger hidden somewhere else about her. It was not only Scots like Lachlan who carried the _skean du_ —or \" _black knife_ \"—in their stockings. This last was a short but broad-bladed dagger narrowing rapidly to a needle point; a weapon that could be very effective at close quarters, as well as being invisible until needed in the ordinary course of events."

In spite of the knight's objections, Jim noticed that the other had a tendency to lean fairly heavily on him from time to time; and guessed that if nothing else the several days in bed had had the effect of making him a little unsteady on his feet. The amount of blood in his body should by now have pretty well replenished itself. It was simply a matter of the slash itself healing safely; and it was still showing a remarkable ability to mend fast.\n\nSo, they had negotiated the stairs on the way down with no trouble, and Brian had been welcomed by all—including a rather distant and lordly welcome from Ewen MacDougall.\n\nWhether it was the tone of this welcome, or a natural antipathy of some sort, MacDougall and Brian seemed to be automatically at swordpoints from the beginning. MacDougall talked deliberately about court doings and Brian had let him talk. Until he mentioned tournaments."

He wound up by asking MacDougall very casually if he had ever had the fortune to break a lance with those same two well-renowned gentlemen and soldiers, or others of equal fame.\n\nHe had obviously found the chink in MacDougal's social armor. The Scot Viscount had indeed been engaged in tournaments, though nowhere near as many as Brian—who, in fact, had been eking out the living of his very poor estate by his winnings in them. The winner of an encounter normally gained the horse, armor and weapons of his opponent, unless the opponent chose to ransom them back from him; and this source of income was about all his broken-down Castle Smythe had to keep it going.\n\nNot merely that; but since MacDougall's tournaments had been all in Scotland, he could not name knights of such international reputation as Manny and Chandos, as opponents. As a result, for the first time since he entered Castle de Mer, he was being made to look less of the completely experienced courtier than he had been presenting himself."

Also, no one else at the table, even Liseth, seemed to take any particular note of the fact that MacDougall was being put down by Brian. But everyone was, of course, aware of what was going on.\n\nThe end result, however, from Jim's standpoint, was unfortunate. That type of exchange between two medieval knights could lead eventually only to armed conflict between them. Jim hated leaving them behind, with no other company but Lachlan and Herrac's sons. Lachlan seemed as likely to encourage a quarrel as prevent it; and none of Herrac's sons had the age and authority to prevent open trouble between two such men of rank and reputation, if matters should get out of hand between Brian and MacDougall.\n\nJim worried. Brian was still in no case to get into a fight with another man who was in good health. Such an encounter could not only mean Brian losing face, but possibly being badly hurt, if not killed. Even if the encounter was disguised as a competition. The wound on Brian's side was not yet healed enough to endure the activities of a body in battle."

But for Jim, the worry was there and it stuck.\n\nIn fact, it kept him company until they went over a little lip of land between some of the same sort of sharply vertical cliffs that he and the others had climbed, following their fight with the Little Men against the Hollow Men.\n\nAbruptly, then, they found themselves moving down a slope into a very pleasant little valley that stretched for some distance, widening as it went, with something at the far end of it that could be buildings, and possibly tilled land. However, not fifty yards in front of them was one of the \"schiltrons\" of the Little Men—drawn up in ranks with spears leveled.

They were accepted onto the land, but not into the homes of the Little Men, very obviously.\n\nAfter what seemed a long time, but was probably only about half an hour, Jim saw a movement in the farther reaches of the valley. Movement which approached them, and finally resolved itself to four teams of eight armed Little Men, each team carrying by poles on their shoulders a sedan chair in which sat another Little Man, obviously much older, white of beard and dressed in white robes.\n\nStill, with these loads, the bearers ran—although they seemed to either keep in step so well, or otherwise match their footfalls so that their running hardly jolted their burdens.

But obviously what their tongues produced was not what Dafydd had said.\n\n\"Sir James came the closest of all of you,\" said Dafydd. \"Perhaps you might use what he says in addressing me.\"\n\n\"What was it you said?\" Herrac demanded, turning in his saddle to face Jim. \"Would you say it again, Sir James?\"\n\n\" _Merlion_ \" said Jim. He was aware himself that a couple of syllables were missing, and that there was none of the musicality in his version of the word he had just spoken that Dafydd had sounded in his. But it was something he could say—and possibly the others, if they needed to.\n\n\" _Merlion_ \" echoed Herrac. \"Well, it is better than Prince of the Sea-washed Mountains; or will be, in talking to my fellow Borderers.\"\n\nHe brightened up suddenly."

Let me be Prince Merlon, then—though I cannot say the ' _r'_ as you do, Sir Herrac—to all other people. It makes no difference. It is a title that is here for a moment and will be gone again shortly.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Herrac; and they all rode happily on to the castle.\n\nBack there, Jim was relieved to find that open trouble had not broken out between Brian and MacDougall. But Brian, having had a taste of being up on his feet, was determined to stay there. Though, mindful of Jim's emphasis on the fact that he curtail his wine drinking, he had now had what he considered his quota for the day and was working his way through some small beer."

I suggest we tell them about you tonight, only if it seems a good time to, and then call you in if the news suits them. After my meeting with the other Borderers tonight I'm going to have to leave again—this time for several days. Because now's close to the time I impersonate MacDougall and meet with the leaders of the Hollow Men. Tomorrow I'll have to leave with a horse carrying the gold; and, come to think of it, perhaps it would not be a bad idea if you went with me, Dafydd, rather than my borrowing some men-at-arms from Sir Herrac to act as guards. The fewer of us to meet them, the less suspicious the Hollow Men we meet are going to be.\"\n\n\"Indeed, that too is welcome to me,\" said Dafydd.\n\nThat ended their talk, and they rejoined those at the high table. The socializing went on through the afternoon and through dinner. Once the actual eating was over, Brian began to show signs of tiredness; and with only a little protest, allowed both Jim and Liseth to help him back up to his room.

Besides, he's a prisoner, and shouldn't be getting into fights anyway.\"\n\n\"It's up to him, then,\" said Brian.

He has had time to take my measure; and I do not believe he would stand against me for more than a few minutes, either with lance on horseback, or on foot with any other weapon. I think he is aware of that fact, also.\"\n\n\"No doubt that's true, Brian,\" Jim said, as they turned down the corridor toward his bedroom. Brian wobbled a little on the turn and grinned weakly.\n\n\"That small beer,\" he said, \"it goes right to a man's head.\"\n\n\"It's not the small beer,\" said Jim, \"it's the wine you took today: and the fact you're still not a well man.

You know I always do my best.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and was asleep before they could leave the room. They went back downstairs to the high table, although Jim had privately decided that he would be disappearing himself shortly if he was going to get a good night's sleep before leaving early in the morning to find the Hollow Men. He had already asked Dafydd to wake him; and the bowman was an infallible alarm clock, as long as time was expressed in the common terms of the medieval period—\"daybreak\"... \"nightfall\"... \"moonrise\"... _etc._ and the churchly hours of worship.\n\nHowever, before Jim and Liseth reached the hall, they were intercepted by Herrac at the foot of the stairs and Herrac led Jim off by himself to another room in the tower.\n\nFor such a simple-looking fortification, the peel tower managed to have a regular rabbit warren of rooms of various sizes. Herrac took him to one which he had not even guessed existed. It was a good-sized room, enough to hold twenty or thirty people; although the number he saw around the long table set up there now, under the burning cressets—for this room had no outside walls, merely air holes in the ceiling to let the cresset smoke out, hopefully to the outside—were only eight individuals."

The table itself was set with food and drink, and all of those there were clearly busy helping themselves to both.\n\nAs Jim took his seat with Herrac beside him, he had a chance to look them over. All wore swords, indicating this was not just a neighborly visit. Beyond this one common note, they were a burly bunch; no two dressed the same. Some wore kilts, others trews—which were sort of like the kind of pants that used to be called plus-fours, ending at the knee—but like the kilts in that they all showed a particular tartan.\n\nA few were dressed simply as any English knight might have been, out of armor; in hose and some kind of upper jacket of various cut, over interior clothing. All wore hats, no two of them alike. This, too, was something Jim had learned about the fourteenth-century period. It was the period of hats. He had guessed that there must be some hundreds at least of different hat styles, for it seemed that every man he met wore a different kind."

Just beyond him...\"\n\nJim's head very quickly began to swim with the names of the other Border leaders he was meeting. Most of them seemed to have place names, but there was a good-sized minority who were introduced by clan names, instead.\n\nSearching his memory, Jim remembered that just because someone like Sir John the Graeme had the name and wore the Graeme kilt, did not mean that he was in any way a speaker for that clan as a whole—except for whatever small part of it might be personally attached to him.\n\nIn fact, many of the men who might ride behind Sir John Graeme might do it under a multitude of different names, for the Border was a stew of people from many different clans.

The Border, he had always heard, thought of itself as a world apart; and certainly such Northumbrians as he had met so far had not forgotten that once their area was a kingdom of its own under the name of Northumbria.\n\n\"That's right, Sir John,\" said Jim. \"I am not the highest-ranked of magicians but I am a qualified one.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Sir John—he came down hard on the word with a touch of local accent so that it came out \" _pairhaps_ \"—\"you wouldn't mind showing us some proof of the magic you can do?\"\n\n\"Sir John!\" said Herrac. \"My son Sir Giles has been with him and seen him work as a magician.

Jim stood up and put a hand on Herrac's shoulder.\n\n\"Sir John,\" he said, looking directly at the Graeme, \"I will be perfectly glad to give you an example.\" He thought of his low account with the Accounting Office, and mentally crossed his fingers that the other would not take him up on what he was about to say. \"If you will show me that you are a skilled swordsman, as a knight must be, by standing up right now and striking a blow with your weapon at the knight next to you.\"\n\nReflexes on the Border were not slow.

At any rate, you will see me, because I will be upon a ledge of rock a little higher than the floor of this place where they are met, handing out to them, one by one, the gold.\"\n\nHe paused again.

They've fought them valiantly, holding their borders against attempts by the Hollow Men to move in on them. They have a right to be there at the final killing.

And being like the rest of you, they make the sort of messes that you humans always make. Although these may be a little worse, since they have no respect for anything, each other, or even themselves.\"\n\nHe opened his jaws once more in the silent wolf laugh.\n\n\"Only me—that is the one thing they respect.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\" asked Dafydd curiously. He had not been in earshot when Snorrl had first mentioned this to Jim.\n\n\"I know not—neither do I care,\" said Snorrl. \"I only enjoy to see them fear me as men fear devils!\""

I think the full effect of you will be greater if they don't know you're going to be there.\"\n\nSnorrl laughed again.\n\n\"It may well be you're right,\" the wolf said.\n\nHe lifted his nose suddenly in the air as he went along.\n\n\"They have set a sentinel,\" he said, \"to warn them of your approach. He's in the low branches of a tree up ahead. Go a little further, and he'll see you. I'll leave you now and meet you again after you've left the camp. Only remember to come back in this direction; though I will be watching and find you, in any case.\"\n\nWith that, abruptly, with that magiclike behavior of wolves, he was gone.\n\nWith word that a sentinel would soon be looking at him, Jim decided he could delay using his small magic account no longer. He had been dressed in those clothes of MacDougall's which would fit him and rode MacDougall's horse. Unfortunately—the other being much smaller—Jim wore his own clothes and armor. But he had been careful to put on the MacDougall's resplendent surcoat over it—and that should be enough to identify him to the Hollow Men leaders."

In particular, his breastplate held the surcoat out as impressively as before. Jim sighed. No wonder the magicians' Accounting Office would rate him no higher than a Class D magician, even when he was apprenticed to one of this world's only three AAA+ rated ones. He would probably never, thought Jim glumly, be anything but a Class D.\n\nHe pushed the thought from him as he and Dafydd, with their pack horses, continued to approach the camp of the Hollow Men's leaders.\n\nThey saw no signs of a sentinel or anyone else; but they smelled the camp before they got to it and when they stepped inside, all the clothing and armor in sight was not lying on the ground but up in the air, molding human shapes."

It smelled like a compound of human waste and decaying food. At least, Jim hoped that it was decaying food, and not the decaying corpse of some unfortunate, present-day mortal who had had the misfortune to cross their path.\n\nBut he could see no signs of a corpse. The clothed and partly clothed Hollow Men were a clump in the center of the clearing. He rode directly to them without saying a word, and pulled up his horse perhaps six feet from them.\n\nSome of the clothed or semiclothed figures either in iron or cloth immediately moved around him to approach the chest-carrying horse behind him.\n\n\"Leave that load alone!\" snapped Jim. \"If you simply rob me now, no more will follow!\""

I do the talking!\" he said to the articles of clothing and armor clustered there. \"Now back off and bring us some wine and three cups!\"\n\nJim and Dafydd dismounted and sat down cross-legged, facing the suit of armor, which had taken a seat on the ground cross-legged before them. A shirt, but nothing else—in fact more of a nightshirt than a shirt—wafted up to him with the empty left sleeve end some inches behind a wine skin, which still had horse fur on the outside and was crudely sewn; and three cups that clustered in mid-air with their handles together, a few inches in front of the equally empty right sleeve."

He made no effort to refill either Jim's or Dafydd's cup.\n\nMeanwhile, both Jim and Dafydd had lifted their cups to their lips. As it approached Jim's mouth, the wine within it seemed to smell to Jim with the same odor as the rest of the camp.

So, with an effort he put the cup to his lips and tilted it, but did not allow the wine within to touch his upper lip or enter his mouth.

As each comes, he will be given his first payment of one-quarter of the gold due him.

But all the same...\"\n\n\"What did she say when you spoke to her of your love?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"She laughed,\" said Brian tragically. \"Laughed.\"\n\n\"She was probably trying to give you a polite way out of it, by pretending to make a joke of it,\" said Jim, rather heartlessly."

Jim sat down with Brian on Dafydd's side of the table, at the opposite end from MacDougall and Liseth.\n\nTrue to his word, Brian did not even look at the couple, but concentrated his attention on the conversation between the two de Mers and Dafydd, and eventually began to join it with reminiscences of his own."

In fact, almost too well.\n\nIt would be a royal kettle of fish if Liseth actually did fall in love with the courtly MacDougall. Even worse, if she told this to Brian; and as a result Brian actually did push the MacDougall to the point where the other challenged him, and they fought. Jim had really no doubt about Brian's ability to dispatch the other man—if Brian had just been completely well.\n\nSince he had been sixteen, Brian had been making a living for his impoverished lands and castle by the one thing permitted to someone of his class—fighting. On top of that, he had the natural attributes of a fighter. His reflexes were as quick as Jim's; and Jim's, on the volleyball court, had been one of his two strengths—the other being his powerful leg muscles that allowed him to jump higher than most for the ball."

It would be doubtful indeed, if in the kind of slugging contest that sword fights between knights actually became, Brian did not cut the MacDougall to pieces, skillful though the Scotsman might be in certain ways or with certain weapons.\n\nAt this moment Herrac came in, and Jim started up from the table, to intercept the older knight and draw him aside just as Brian had drawn Jim, himself, aside. He wanted to discuss with the Lord of Castle de Mer all that had gone on with the Hollow Men.\n\nThey ended up talking in that same room where they had talked before. The one that Jim had come to think of as Herrac's \"study.\" Certainly, it was a room private to the ruler of this particular castle. Herrac listened to all that Jim had to say, in silence.

Together, Borderers and Little Men should finally form a ring that keeps closing in on the Hollow Men; until, toward the last, the Borderers should slip back and allow the schiltrons of the Little Men to close together and drive the last of the Hollow Men against the cliff and make sure of their death.

His bow was still over his shoulder and his quiver at his side. He had not taken them off because none of the others around him had taken off their swords; in spite of the polite rule that when visiting a neighbor the sword was removed, even if other weapons were carried about the person. As at the earlier meeting, it seemed to be generally conceded that this was a council of war, rather than a neighborly visit."

        "a": "The meeting started out with a number of introductions of Jim and Dafydd to those who had not been there before. By this time, Jim had forgotten all but the names of a few of those he had met, but the ones he did remember, like William of Berwick, a round-faced, round-bodied man in his forties, under thinning gray hair, stuck firmly in his mind.\n\nThat part of the business over, Herrac spoke—and there was an almost instant silence as he began to explain that since their first meeting, Jim had seen and made arrangements both with the Hollow Men and with the Little Men; and they should all appreciate this effort for which he had been uniquely equipped, being magician as well as knight. He then turned the speaker's position over to Jim so that Jim could tell them about both meetings.\n\nJim stood up, to make sure that everyone in the room could not only hear but see him, and again told them first the plan, which was to entice all the Hollow Men to this one particular spot where they could be trapped, under the guise of paying them the first installment of Scottish money; then described how his encounter had gone with Eshan, the leader of the Hollow Men."

He was about to mention that Herrac had been with him, when he realized that the \"ye\" that Sir John had used, in this case, was a plural pronoun. \"As you know, Sir John, and perhaps some of these other knights also, Sir Herrac was with me, as well as his Highness here, the Prince Merlion.\"\n\nHe paused for just a second. But there was no sound from those in the room to give him an indication of how his words were being received. He went on.\n\n\"We talked with Ardac, son of Lutel, and the five chief advisors of the Little Men. I told them everything I had done so far, and gave the date for which the destruction of the Hollow Men had been set... I did not firmly set a time for a final council just before the battle,\" he wound up, \"but I suggest it take place the night before. I will send that message to them if the rest of you agree.\""

Then there were a few scattered cries of \"Yes!\" here and there about the room; followed almost immediately by a flood of voices agreeing with the selection. Sir John, who had opened his mouth to speak, sank back on his bench, closing his mouth, with a slight frown on his face.\n\n\"I think,\" said Sir John unexpectedly, \"that we have yet to hear Sir Herrac himself agree to taking that responsibility. Do you, Sir Herrac?\"\n\nHerrac's deep and powerful voice rang almost unexpectedly through the Hall.\n\n\"I am not one that likes to be a leader,\" he said. \"I think all here know that. My duty is to my family and my heritage which is my castle and its lands. Nonetheless, in this case, where it is so important that the Hollow Men be finished once and for all, I do accept!\""

I guessed eighteen—I see that I was wrong. We will have more than that. Ardac, son of Lutel, then answered me that in that case eighteen Little Men would be sent to join the council.\"\n\nA clamor broke out in the room, of half a dozen voices speaking at once, with an undertone of angry mutters in the background.\n\n\"What gives them to think that we will welcome eighteen of them to our council?\" shouted William of Berwick, pounding the table. \"One were enough, and more than enough, to carry our decisions back to them. After all, they will be fighting under our command.\"\n\nThere was a silence following that, and Jim found himself glad that he was on his feet."

They will be under their own commander, who is Prince Merlion here—who shares some ancient brotherhood of blood with them.\"\n\n\"This is foolish,\" said Sir John the Graeme. \"Two leaders will simply make a disaster of our fight. Yet I admit it is hard to ask his Highness here to serve under a simple, if noble, knight like Sir Herrac.\"\n\n\"I am willing.\" Dafydd's voice, soft as usual, still carried through the room.\n\n\"Why that, I say?\" shouted William of Berwick, hitting the table again. \"What need we with the Little Men at all? It is our right to destroy the Hollow Men, ours alone. And we will do it with ease!\"\n\nThere was a thud suddenly in the middle of the table and every man there froze, for one of Dafydd's war arrows stood with its head all but buried to the tines in the thick, oak top of the table.\n\n\"Permit me to dispute with you somewhat on that point, Sir William,\" said Dafydd, gently but carryingly.\n\nHe had come into the Hall with his bow on his shoulder and his arrows on his hip, since the others were all wearing their swords, and they—living in a country where the archers were weak; and in a land and time in which all belted and armored knights looked down their noses at the commoners who bore bows—had never stopped to think what a weapon it was, and that it could be used indoors in this fashion. It had simply never crossed their minds. Swordplay between these walls, they could have envisioned. But not this."

Let me show you how it would have gone had I plucked it a little further.\"\n\nSo fast that it almost seemed like a form of magic itself, another arrow was fitted to Dafydd's bow and flew from it—into and through the table until it rested against the floor beneath. Only the tips of its feathers and its notched end showing above the table top.\n\n\"You see,\" said Dafydd, almost kindly, \"that this bow of mine is not an unworthy weapon. In fact—perhaps, Sir Herrac, you would now have summoned in to us your son Sir Giles, who was with Sir James and myself in France, that he might tell the story of the sword with which he defended the Crown Prince of England against nearly a score of knights belonging to an evil magician. Will you do so, Sir Herrac?\"\n\nFor answer Herrac merely turned his head, lifted his voice and bellowed out a call that would easily have penetrated the door behind him and the servant waiting without."

Fetch Sir Giles_ — _at once_!\"\n\nThe door was opened almost as if on cue and Sir Giles stepped through into the room, closing the door again behind him.\n\n\"There was no need to seek me, Father,\" he said. \"I, also, have been waiting outside to hear the results of your meeting.\"\n\n\"His Highness, here,\" said Herrac, still letting his voice roll through the chamber, \"would that you tell of a sword with which you defended the Prince of England last year in France.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father,\" said Giles. He looked down the table and lifted his voice to reach everyone in the room. \"The sword with which I had the honor to fight for the young Prince, was one that I got from the Prince Merlon, himself.\"\n\nHe turned to Dafydd.\n\n\"Noble Sir?\" he asked. \"What is it you wish me to tell these gentlemen about the sword?\"\n\n\"All,\" said Dafydd. \"From what I told you of how it came into my hands until how it passed into your hands.\"\n\n\"I will be more than willing to do so,\" said Sir Giles. He was probably the shortest man there. But his mustache bristled fiercely; and the large nose of which he was normally rather ashamed lifted proudly like the prow of a ship about to go into battle."

For what is a knight without his sword?\"\n\nThere were murmurs of agreement around the room. Jim was a little surprised, then remembered that these Northumbrians were only recently included under the English Crown; and, in any case, they would not have been all that ready to give up their swords themselves.\n\n\"So we hesitated,\" went on Sir Giles. \"And his—the Prince Merlon—said to the Prince Edward, who knew him only as a simple bowman, that perhaps he could solve the problem. The Prince Merlon then went off, and returned from his baggage with a magnificent knight's sword in a jeweled scabbard.

While I took the sword that the Prince Merlon had brought and hooked it to my own belt. It was with that sword, then, that I essayed to keep the young Prince of England safe against his enemies.\"\n\nHe stopped speaking.\n\n\"Thank you, Sir Giles,\" said Dafydd. \"But you have not yet told how the sword came into my hands.\"\n\n\"Oh. Forgive me,\" said Sir Giles. \"I should tell you all\"—he was addressing the room once more—\"that Da—\"\n\nSir Giles caught himself just in time.\n\n\"—His Highness of Merlon told us the story of how he had acquired the sword. It was at a time when he was disguised as a bowman, as he is now, but in that land that was formerly called Wales, but now is English territory. It seems that one of the English Wardens there believed in holding tournaments to demonstrate the prowess of his knights, particularly to his Welsh subjects. This day the Warden had thought of an additional entertainment.\""

These five were on horseback, and he alone, afoot, with his bow. They rode upon him, but he slew them all with his arrows before they reached him; before indeed they were even close to him.\"\n\nGiles paused again; but in this instance it was to give the muttering this statement had given rise to time to die down.\n\n\"He had made a request that if he should win the day, he should—like any victor in the list—win also the arms and armor of his opponents; and the Warden had laughingly agreed. As a result, he came into possession of all the armor and weapons of those he had just killed; but turned all back except this one sword, which he kept. The which he had brought with him, and later offered to the Prince. Again, it was this sword with which I essayed to defend his Grace of England.\""

This weapon is not usual among you gentlemen, and no gentleman uses it except for hunting or sport. But it is a powerful weapon, nonetheless; and I, for one, do not feel my rank diminished by the fact that I go disguised as an ordinary man of the bow.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"I would that you consider, therefore and likewise, gentlemen, that no gentleman ever bands with other gentles in a schiltron, on foot, with spears, to meet their enemies. Yet the Little Men do this, and do it well. May I point out they have held their borders against the Hollow Men all these centuries, which is no mean feat. You who have met scattered bands of the Hollow Men know that they are not easy to fight.\n\n\"What I am saying,\" Dafydd said, \"is that they, by right of combat and blood and lives lost, have as much right to be there at the ending of the Hollow Men as yourselves. They have won that right on fields of battles, innumerable. I am proud to be chosen their leader, and I am not too proud to serve under Sir Herrac, as our supreme commander. But, since I know many of you feel uneasy about the Little Men, I asked that they reduce their number from eighteen to no more than five representatives at our council the night before the battle.

Into this tightening silence, Herrac's voice broke like the prow of a ship splintering its way through new ice over freezing water.\n\n\"As the chosen commander of the Borderers in this endeavor,\" his powerful voice said flatly, \"I accept the Prince Merlon's proposal that no more than five of the Little Men shall meet with us on the night before our battle with the Hollow Men in council for final planning. Any who wish not to follow me in this matter may now declare themselves apart from it and leave the rest of us.

It will be no easy task.\"\n\nHe broke off for a moment to emphasize his last words.\n\n\"I have already considered some plans of battle,\" he went on. \"I will continue to consider them; and do all of you consider, yourselves, whether there is anything that we might do that would improve our chances of winning this battle, with as little loss on our own side as possible. Then, if you think of any such, bring it to the council on the eve of battle, to be spoken there; and advise the rest of us on it. For tonight, unless there is further discussion of anything important, I will declare this meeting closed.\"\n\nThere was another silence; but this time it was a short one.\n\n\"I would believe our commander has the right of it,\" put in Sir John Graeme. \"I can think of no further reason to prolong this meeting.

The door had been opened and Herrac had led the way out, followed by Jim and Dafydd, with Sir John Graeme close behind them. The rest trailed after in an unstructured, loudly talking tail of men that wound through the short corridor outside and into the Great Hall of the castle where they had gathered.\n\nThe meeting, as was not uncommon in medieval matters, turned into a drinking party.\n\nJim, taking advantage of the pretense that he had things to do, left early so as not to befuddle himself with more wine than he wanted to drink. Dafydd chose to come with him—and, surprisingly, Herrac as well.\n\n\"I thought you might feel obligated to stay, Sir Herrac,\" said Jim, once they were on their horses outside and headed back toward Castle de Mer; with Sir Giles and some of the de Mer men-at-arms riding with them, on general principles of defense, considering the land and the times."

Herrac went on.\n\n\"It is my belief that a commander should be at some distance from those he commands. Since you two gentlemen are guests of mine, I can hardly distance myself from you. But I intend to either command or not command; and I think the first step in that direction is to establish the distance I spoke of.\"\n\n\"I agree with Dafydd,\" said Jim, just loudly enough to be heard over the creak of their saddles and the sound of their horses' hooves on the hard ground underneath. It was a chill, cloudless night that made the horses' breath smoke before them, and the moon was three-quarters full. Their road was bright enough, accordingly, so that none of the party were required to carry torches and go ahead. Jim found himself appreciating Herrac's position."

None of us meant you to take the responsibility all on yourself—\n\n\"That is my job now,\" interrupted Herrac. \"Would you not consider it your job, if you had the command in keeping, Sir James?\"\n\nJim thought for a moment and was a little surprised.\n\n\"I might,\" he said. \"Yes, I might just do exactly that. Still, it was your presence and your voice that did it just now; and I doubt mine would have had that persuasive an effect on all the other Borderers there.\"\n\n\"They know me,\" said Herrac briefly.\n\nJim could well believe it.

He exclaimed with delight over the account of Herrac's command that the Little Men should be accepted at the council; and applauded when Jim repeated Herrac's remark later that a commander should be a certain distance from those he commanded.\n\n\"How very right the good knight is!\" said Brian. \"I've yet to see a successful leader of men who did not keep his distance. Those who mix and mingle with the ones they lead are invariably liked and well thought of, but not always well obeyed. Better for all to be apart; and even—yes—disliked by those you lead; than to be too close, so that you are taken for less than you are.\""

Sir Herrac is a natural leader.\"\n\n\"We, his sons,\" put in Sir Giles, \"have known this all our lives. You do not have any idea how much Father has seen his responsibility to his family. Not the least to my mother, who he loved most dearly; as did we all.\"\n\nThe last words ended on a note of sadness; which might have blighted the conversation for a while, if Brian had not burst out in a new direction.\n\n\"But you, James!\" he said. \"You must begin practicing immediately; and it must be well away from this castle here, so that no eyes, that should not, see that perhaps you are a little rusty, or not yet as skilled as you might be with weapons.\"\n\n\"That's a polite way of putting it, Brian,\" said Jim. \"You know, and we all here know, that I'm nothing to talk about as a fighter. My great fight against the Ogre was with the advantage of the reflexes of the dragon whose body I was in. If it hadn't been for Gorbash, the Ogre would have squashed me in half a minute—\""

I would counsel that not even Sir Herrac—if you will pardon me, Sir Giles—know of you and your limitations with sword and other like tools.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said Jim thoughtfully.\n\n\"We must all go off by ourselves from the castle tomorrow,\" Brian went on. \"All of us, that is, except you, Dafydd—unless there is some reason you want to accompany us. Then, when we are a distance from the castle that is sufficient to make sure we cannot be overseen or overheard. Sir Giles will practice with you with the various weapons; and I will stand by and order that practice, since I am yet perhaps a day or two from being able to practice with you myself.\"\n\nHe was a good deal more than a day or two, Jim thought. But he knew better than to mention such a thing in front of Brian. Instead he struck another note.\n\n\"It really isn't necessary, Brian,\" he said. \"Remember, I've told you what our plans are like.

In the heat and turmoil of battle, friend can even strike friend, either through error or because the battle urge has been wakened so strongly in him. You may even have to use your shield to protect yourself from the Borderers, to pass through them to safety. No, no. You must practice; and we will do things as I suggested!\"\n\nSo they did.\n\nFollowing that evening, Jim left every morning with Brian and Giles; and very often with Dafydd as well. They rode off for half an hour or more until they were in some secluded, tree-hidden spot, well away from the castle and where there was room for the practice Brian had in mind. There he put Jim and—inevitably—Sir Giles as well, through a course of instruction; with all kinds of weapons from poignard up through mace."

Jim took off his helm and wiped his soaking wet forehead. \"How would you like to take a little of this training, for a while?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Dafydd, \"I have been watching with interest. But I would not venture to ask that a knight train me in a knight's way of combat; who am really, as you all know, no more than a common bowman.\"\n\n\"The hell with that!\" said Brian, who was almost frothing at the mouth with his desire to instruct. \"I'll teach you any day. Are you willing?\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" said Dafydd. \"But I will need armor, even if I can borrow weapons.\"\n\n\"Mine will fit you tolerably well,\" said Jim. \"We're close enough in height. Your shoulders may be a little broader than mine, and you may be a little slimmer otherwise than I am, but I think it'll do. Want to try it?\""

And Brian ended up delighted with his new pupil; who in many ways showed much more aptitude for what he was taught than either Sir Giles or Jim—but Jim, as they all knew, was something of a lost cause. Too much of what Brian taught had to be learned starting in childhood. The surprising thing was that the disciplines Dafydd seemed to have learned with his bowmanship in his early years should help him adapt so quickly to make use of Brian's teaching. The truth was, Jim thought, Dafydd—like Brian—was a natural athlete.\n\nIt occurred to Jim that Dafydd might be very like some particularly skilled, twentieth-century professional football player of his own world; who, on taking an interest in golf, which he had never played before, in a few weeks is doing the full eighteen holes at an enviably low score.\n\nMeanwhile back at this castle and the castles of the other Borderers, preparations for the battle continued.

One was that not as many of the Borderers might show up as promised. Second was that the Little Men wanted to be sure of being equally represented with the taller humans when the battle started.\n\nBeyond this, Ardac agreed readily enough to the fact that the Little Men should make the first attack, afterwards opening corridors to let the Borderers in through them, to deal particularly with the Hollow Men who were mounted on their ghost horses."

Also, gold is no use in the making of tools or weapons. Finally, I have to say that from what we have seen of its effect among your kind, we would rather not be touched with the desire for it. If there is gold, your Borderers may have it; and be welcome for all of us.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ardac,\" said Herrac. \"I was sure that would be your answer. But as commander I had to ask.

How did you plan that your schiltrons would gather?\"\n\n\"Once your people are gathered,\" said Ardac, \"we will move in to join you. You need not ask how we are marshaled beforehand, nor where we come together, nor any other question of how we shall join you. Let it be enough for you that we are an older and more experienced people; and moreover we know those woods and rocks in a way that your people will never know them; unless they spend as many centuries among them as we have. We can be scattered and out of sight, not one of us showing, then in a hundred breaths be all drawn up in our schiltrons and ready to move.

So you may use those terms with us freely, although we will not use them ourselves. Yes, those hours are agreeable; and we will be there, as you wish. At that time I suggest that you and I, Sir James, Prince Merlion\"—he gave it the proper pronunciation—\"and one or two others if must be, meet with myself and the other schiltron-leaders before we move up close to where the Hollow Men will be.\"\n\n\"That is agreeable to me,\" said Herrac. \"It shall be so.

Jim, Dafydd and Herrac mounted their horses and rode off back to Castle de Mer. There, Herrac went off to deal with matters of his own concern, and Dafydd and Jim went up to acquaint an impatient Brian with the news of what had gone on at their meeting.\n\nIt seemed to Jim, as they talked, that Brian was much more wound up about this oncoming battle than he ordinarily would have been. Jim was a little puzzled by this; and then the realization occurred to him that fighting was the one thing that could take his mind off his newly found love for Liseth, and her constant companionship with Ewen MacDougall.

Otherwise with someone like him, who was used to a Royal Court's sort of brief dalliance followed by a quick tumble into bed together, he would have cooled off in his enthusiasm before this.\n\nAs to whether Liseth was at all attracted to MacDougall or not, Jim became more and more puzzled by this all the time. If she was not attracted by him, then she was a most excellent actress. A most surprisingly excellent actress for a young woman who had grown up in an isolated castle next to the sea and the Scottish border in the lightly populated land that was Northumberland. There was nothing to be done about it by Jim in any case; so he simply sat back and turned his thoughts to the more important matter, which was getting ready for the fight.\n\nHe took the practice sessions in grave earnest. Now, Brian was enough recovered to work out with him, although Jim would hardly have believed that he would have been able to. Brian was still insisting—and now Jim saw that there would be no stopping him—that he would be part of the Borderer group when it went against the Hollow Men."

It must be the Great Hall, since there was no other room in his home that would comfortably hold the number of individuals who would be attending.\n\nJim, with the late afternoon sun slanting through the arrow slits let into the outside wall of his small stone room, was making a final effort to contact Carolinus by dream. He had already tried several times in the past few days; but curiously, had been unable to get through to his tutor in magic.\n\nHe had found that, if he fell asleep while wanting to have a dream conversation with Carolinus, it happened more quickly if he wrote a sleep spell on what he pictured as the inside of his forehead.

The other only abandoned his usual irascibility when he wanted to soften the blow of unhappy news.\n\n\"I—\" began Jim; but Carolinus cut him off.\n\n\"I should warn you first,\" Carolinus almost snapped in his usual manner, \"that you now face both a dangerous and difficult time.

In other words, things seem in hand up here—depending upon whether we can win the battle or not. But I wanted to ask you—have _you_ learned anything more about the Worm, and the Dark Powers' involvement in this?\"\n\n\"No, and no,\" said Carolinus decisively, \"particularly as regards the Worm. I've no idea why it's there by itself, what it's supposed to be doing and why it's appeared at all; in defiance of the usual practice of the Dark Powers of keeping such creatures close to one of their centers of power.

We will not meet with the rest of you at the place where you have planned all together before moving up toward the assault on the Hollow Men. But our leaders will meet with your leaders, there—once you are so gathered. Otherwise, you will not see any of us until you are up close, yourselves encircling the place where the Hollow Men are met. We have our own way of moving through the woods and its manner need not concern you. The only thing that need do so is that you can be certain you will find us in position when you move up behind us, ready for the attack on the Hollow Men.\""

Consequently we wish him to return with us tonight and set out with us tomorrow so that you will also meet him for the first time tomorrow when you have moved up into position around the place where the Hollow Men are gathered.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Ardac, son of Lutel,\" said Dafydd. Again, his soft voice seemed to carry as it did when he wanted it to. He was clearly being heard by everyone. \"I will be your leader, and represent you in all things. But I cannot go with you tonight nor move with you tomorrow. I will not be with the attackers. I will be with Sir James Eckert de Bois de Malencontri on the ledge as he begins to hand out the gold wherewith the Hollow Men expect to be paid. You have all been given your map of that clearing; and you know how there is a rocky ledge at the base of a part of the cliffs that will hold us two or three feet above the floor of the main clearing.

It was Snorrl, the wolf, come from some dark shadowed corner of the hall.\n\nHe had leaped up on the end of the table in front of Christopher, the youngest of Herrac's sons; and now he moved down nearly the half length of it, to put him before Jim. There he stopped and turned to face those in the hall. \"I am Snorrl, a Northumbrian wolf. Some of you may have known of me, or have heard me when I sing on frosty nights. I will be on that ledge as well; because the Hollow Men fear wolves as the rest of you fear all things of darkness. Those of you who did not know that before, know it now; because I have just told you.\"\n\nHe opened his jaws for a moment and laughed at them in his silent way.\n\n\"So,\" he went on, \"now that you have been educated by Snorrl, whose people owned this land before any of your kind ever came here, I will leave you to your foolish talk.

Not only the Borderers but the Little Men themselves stared in Jim's direction like people hypnotized.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Jim, when the silence had gone on so long that it was threatening to become embarrassing, \"I should say a few words at this point. I am, as you all know, a magician as well as a knight. You haven't seen me working magic, because magic is not worked lightly. When you see me next, however, I'll look differently. While I am on the ledge handing out the gold, I will be dressed as Ewen MacDougall, the Scot King's envoy to the Hollow Men, is dressed, and I will be wearing his face. I may make some other small magic, but that does not concern you. I tell you about myself now, because once the Hollow Men are encircled and as soon as they've been driven in far enough for you Borderers to move in, and take advantage of the lanes the Little Men will open for you through their ranks, I will know that you are driving to consolidate the victory that they have begun.\""

I charge the rest of you to be on watch for us, so that you too may let us through when we come. I will have my own face back again by that time, but I will still be wearing over my armor a surcoat that belongs to Ewen MacDougall. As you leave, you will find, fastened to a pillar by the door, that surcoat; with his coat of arms upon it and his clan's war cry—' _Buaidh no Bas'_.\"\n\nThe gaelic words of the war cry, which meant \" _Victory or death_ \" had been taught Jim by Giles.

But when the time came he had found words inside him that must be said. The men beside him and before him were men who had probably in their time hunted wolves when they saw them, and tried to kill them. Snorrl, effective as he might be, should not have to run a gauntlet of blood-mad Borderers.\n\nThis time, it was the voice of Herrac that broke tension and silence at the same time.\n\n\"Very well, gentlemen,\" the shock of his great voice brought them out of their daze, \"we have heard I think from all who have anything particular to tell us. Is there anyone else who wishes to speak on any matter?\"\n\nHe looked down along the edge of the table to Sir John the Graeme. Sir John shook his head.

Those who wish to stay and speak, either with each other, or with one of us here at the high table, are free to do so.\"\n\nWith that, the outbreak of voices, which had stilled itself momentarily when he began to speak, broke out again, louder than before.

Best that when we leave, he leaves in the midst of us; with you, James, going first, I on your right side and a little behind to protect the wolf and Brian likewise on your left.\"\n\n\"No one seems particularly anxious to come up and talk to us,\" said Jim.\n\n\"It may be the rank that Dafydd now wears,\" answered Brian in the same low voice, \"as well as our reputation, which I do not doubt all know. These are proud men, these Northumbrians. They would not like to be seen by their neighbors as seeming to scrape acquaintance with those of fame or rank.

Then it was through the kitchen and up the stairs to the room which had been Brian and Dafydd's alone; since Jim had required separate quarters for himself.\n\nWhen they went in, they found that the room had been readied for Brian and Dafydd's going to bed. The cressets were lit, but the room was only moderately smoky; and a pitcher of wine with cups were set on the table. A single servant—their number had been reduced as Brian got more and more healthy—sat on the floor in the corner. He got hastily to his feet as they came in.\n\n\"Another pitcher; and then wait outside!\" Brian commanded him.\n\n\"Yes, Sir Brian—\" The man hurried off.\n\nLeft alone, the three of them sat down at the table and Brian filled cups from the pitcher.

I've had a look at that ledge close up, and I think we can lead the horses up on to it as well. It's not too wide, but it's easily long enough to leave them at one end, unload the chests—by the way, we must do that ourselves, and not let the Hollow Men help, or we may have one of them trying to get a handful of gold ahead of time.\"\n\n\"That is a danger, to be sure,\" said Dafydd. \"Perhaps if you placed some sort of magic sign upon the chests and told them as we mounted the ledge of some dire thing that would happen to them if they tried to touch it before we had opened the cases ourselves and distributed what was within.\""

I will have just enough to change my face to the appearance of Ewen MacDougall's, and hope it lasts as long as it needs to while we're up on the ledge. Also, I need to use some of it, the magic that is, to make Snorrl look twice his size. I think that this will strongly impress the Hollow Men. Don't let it fool the two of you, however. For all his appearance of larger size, Snorrl will be the same wolf, with the same strength and no more.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence from the other two.\n\n\"It is well you told us this now, James,\" said Dafydd.\n\n\"Very well indeed—\" began Brian in agreement, and stopped talking abruptly as the door to the room swung open and the servant came in with another full pitcher of wine.
